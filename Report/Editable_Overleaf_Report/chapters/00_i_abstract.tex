The accurate classification of cat and dog breeds is essential for various applications in animal care, particularly kennels and catteries where identifying breeds quickly and efficiently can help provide the necessary care. This project explores the use of deep learning techniques to classify images of cats and dogs into 37 distinct breeds. Using a dataset with over 7,000 images, I employed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and utilized transfer learning with the pre-trained InceptionV3 model to enhance performance. Data augmentation techniques were also incorporated to improve the model's generalization and accuracy. The final model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding 95\%, demonstrating the potential of deep learning models in real-world applications where quick and accurate breed identification is required. This approach not only improves efficiency but also has the potential to reduce the manual effort involved in breed identification, benefiting both animal care facilities and pet owners.
