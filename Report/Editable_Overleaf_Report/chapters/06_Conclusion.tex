\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:reflection}
In conclusion, after experimenting with two distinct model architectures, tuning hyper-parameters, and utilizing data augmentation techniques, I was able to develop a model that achieved an average accuracy of 95.5\% for classifying 37 different categories. This performance exceeds that of several similar studies I reviewed. While the model has proven effective, there are clear areas for improvement. Limited time and computational resources prevented me from testing a wider range of hyper-parameters, such as the number of epochs, batch size, and the optimal layer unfreezing during fine-tuning. Further exploration of advanced data augmentation techniques could also enhance model performance.
