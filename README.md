# Classification of Cat and Dog Breeds Using Machine Learning Techniques

## Overview

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques for classifying cat and dog breeds into 37 distinct categories. It leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning (InceptionV3) to achieve high accuracy, making it useful for real-world scenarios such as veterinary clinics, shelters, and pet care businesses.

The final model achieved a classification accuracy of **95.5%** by incorporating advanced data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and robust evaluation methods.
